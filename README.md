**Module Name** : mealy_1010_seq_det_non_over

**Mentor:** NEELA SANTHOSH KUMAR

**OVERVIEW OF THE PROJECT**

**Project** : FINITE STATE MACHINE (FSM) DESIGN

**Objective:**

**Design and implement a Finite State Machine (FSM) that can model and control a specific system or process, such as:**

      A vending machine
      A traffic light controller
      A digital clock
      A robotic arm
      
**Key Activities:**

1.Requirements gathering: Define project scope, goals, and deliverables.

2.System analysis: Study the system or process to be modeled by the FSM.

3.State identification: Identify and define the states of the system or process.

4.Transition definition: Define the transitions between states.

5.State transition diagram/table creation: Create a visual representation of the FSM.

6.FSM implementation: Write code or design hardware to implement the FSM.

7.Simulation/testing: Verify and validate the FSM through simulation or testing.

8.Debugging: Identify and fix errors or issues in the FSM.

9.Optimization: Refine the FSM for efficiency, scalability, and reliability.

10.Documentation: Write a report detailing the FSM design and implementation.

11.Testing and validation: Develop test cases and report results.

12.Review and revision: Review the FSM design and implementation, and make revisions as needed.
